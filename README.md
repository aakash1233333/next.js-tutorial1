What are Package Managers ??
Package managers for JavaScript are tools that automate the process of installing, updating, configuring, and managing dependencies (i.e., other libraries and frameworks) that a JavaScript project requires. Package managers make it easy to reuse code and avoid writing the same code over and over again, saving time and effort for developers.

The two most commonly used package managers for JavaScript are:

npm (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. npm is widely used and has a large community of contributors, making it easy to find and use a wide range of packages for your project.

Yarn: Yarn is a newer package manager for JavaScript that was developed by Facebook. It was designed to address some of the shortcomings of npm, such as slow installation times and dependency conflicts.


Server-side rendering: Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box, which means that the initial HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the browser, improving the page's initial load time and SEO.

Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, which are loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time and improving performance.

Easy setup and configuration: Next.js comes with a built-in development server, automatic code compilation, and automatic code reloading, making it easy to get started with building React applications.

Static site generation: Next.js also supports static site generation (SSG), which generates HTML pages at build time, enabling fast page loads and better SEO.

API routes: Next.js provides built-in support for creating API routes, making it easy to build APIs to fetch data for your application.

Middleware support: Next.js supports middleware, which allows you to add custom functionality to the server, such as authentication or logging.

Overall, Next.js makes it easier to build complex React applications with server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy setup and configuration. It also provides a range of features that make it easier to build fast and scalable applications, such as static site generation and API routes.
